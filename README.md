# Direct-and-Iterative-Solver-of-Linear-Systems
# Coded in Python


In this paper, we will be evaluating numerical methods for direct and iterative solvers of linear systems. 
From class we have discussed the various methods; Gauss elimination with pivoting techniques, 
Jacobi Iterative Method, Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method, Successive Over-Relaxation Method, 
Iterative Refinement Method, and Conjugate Gradient Method. 

In this paper, using Python programming language, 
we will discuss how each method evaluates various linear systems of equations, 
and then we will discuss the complexity, accuracy, and stability of each method
